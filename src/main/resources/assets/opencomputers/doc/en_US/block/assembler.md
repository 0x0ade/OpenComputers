# Assembler

![Harder, better, faster, stronger.](oredict:oc:assembler)

The assembler is an advanced workstation that can be used to build more complex electronic devices, such as [robots](robot.md), [drones](../item/drone.md) and [tablets](../item/tablet.md). They usually require a relatively large amount of energy to assemble these devices, so it is recommended to power them sufficiently, for example by building a few [capacitors](capacitor.md).

To build a device using an assembler, first insert the base part for that device. For [robots](robot.md) that is a [computer case](case1.md) of any tier, for tablets that is a [tablet case](../item/tabletCase1.md), for example. As in all OpenComputers inventories, the parts that can be inserted into selective slots are highlighted in your inventory when hovering the slots. If you have NEI open, and compatible pages are on the currently visible page, they will also be highlighted. Continue to insert any parts you would like the device to contain. Take particular care to provide an operating system, or a possibility to install one later on (for robots you can install a [disk drive](diskDrive.md) to insert and remove [floppies](../item/floppy.md) later on, for example). For most devices, their [EEPROM](../item/eeprom.md) can be changed later on, by crafting them together with the EEPROM to insert in them. If there already was an EEPROM present, the old one will be returned to your inventory.

Also note that for [robots](robot.md) to have a [screen](screen1.md) you need to install a tier one screen in them, and to allow typing on the screen you also need to install a [keyboard](keyboard.md). For [tablets](../item/tablet.md) the screen is pre-installed in the tablet case, but you still need to install a keyboard if you wish to type on your [tablet](../item/tablet.md).

Once everything is in place, press the start button and wait for the device to be assembled and charged. It is important to remember that you *cannot* change the device after it has been assembled. If you forgot something or made a mistake, you will have to disassemble the device completely using the [disassembler](disassembler.md), which has a slight chance of breaking parts in the process.

A final note on complexity: the tier of an item determines how much complexity it requires, with tier 1 items requiring 1 complexity, tier 2 requiring 2 and tier 3 requiring 3. A special case are container upgrades, such as [upgrade containers](../item/upgradeContainer1.md) and [card containers](../item/cardContainer1.md), which use twice the complexity of their own tier.
